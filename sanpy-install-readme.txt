I will start putting new versions of SanPy into our shared "SAN AP" box folder. This is the recipe for installing any new version of SanPy. Keep in mind, as we move forward the 'creating date' will be different.

1) Go to our shared box folder "SAN AP/SanPy"

2) Copy SanPy-20201217a.zip to your Desktop

3) Uncompress the .zip into the folder Desktop/SanPy-20201217a

5) Install SanPy

	Go into the new 'SanPy-20201217a' folder and double-click the 'install' file.

	After some time, install should finish with something like the following. If it does not, this is an ERROR!

	"
	Installing collected packages: sanpy
	  Running setup.py develop for sanpy
	Successfully installed sanpy
	Install successful. Run the Analysis app with './run'
	"

	Once install is done, you can close the terminal window

6) Run SanPy

	Go into the new 'SanPy-20201217a' folder and double-click the 'run' file.

	Once you quit SanPy, you can close the extra terminal window.

	If SanPy has a bug or crashed, copy/paste the output of the terminal into an email or a slack post.

Note: You can make an alias of the 'run' file and put it wherever you like. You also want to rename the alias something like 'SanPy 20201217a'.
