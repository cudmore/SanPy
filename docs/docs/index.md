SanPy is software to perform [cardiac action potential][cardiac action potential] analysis. It is primarily designed to analyze spontaneous cardiac action potentials from [whole-cell current-clamp][patch-clamp] recordings of [cardiac myocytes].

## This is a work in progress, do not use this code.

If you find the code in this repository interesting, please email Robert Cudmore at UC Davis (rhcudmore@ucdavis.edu) and we can get you started. We are looking for users and collaborators.
