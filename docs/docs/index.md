SanPy is software to perform analysis of spontaneous [cardiac action potentials][cardiac action potential] from [whole-cell current-clamp][patch-clamp] recordings of [cardiac myocytes].

This is a work-in-progress and under heavy development. If you find the code in this repository interesting, please email Robert Cudmore at UC Davis (rhcudmore@ucdavis.edu) and we can get you started. We are looking for users and collaborators.

Our primary goals are to create desktop and web based interfaces for e-phys analysis.
