## Why is this useful?

We provide a Python package that can load, analyze, plot, and save eletropysiology recordings. This package is then accessed through a desktop application with a simple to use graphical user interface (GUI). Finally, the same code that drives the GUI  can be scripted. In just a few lines of code, the exact same loading, analysis, plotting, and saving can be performed as is done with the GUI.

## Why is this important?

When you publish a paper, you need to ensure your primary data is available for interogation and that your analysis can be reproduced. This software facilitates that by allowing you to share the raw data, provide the code that was used to analyze it, and explicity show how it was analyzed such that it can be verified and reproduced.
