## SanPy is software for whole-cell current clamp analysis

SanPy is designed to analyze action potentials and extract a number of parameters including spike time, voltage threshold, half-widths, interval statistics, and lots more.

SanPy is optimized for a wide range of whole-cell current-clamp recordings including cardiac myocytes and neurons.

Please see the [SanPy documentation](https://cudmore.github.io/SanPy/).
