## SanPy is software for whole-cell current clamp analysis

Originally designed for cardiac myocytes, we have been busy extending SanPy to handle a wide range of whole-cell current clamp recordings including neurons.

## Please see our [documentation website](https://cudmore.github.io/SanPy/).

## Desktop Application

We now provide [macOS and Windows downloads](https://cudmore.github.io/SanPy/download/) to run the desktop application. No command line, no complicated installation, just an easy to use point and click GUI.

## Plugins
 
The desktop application comes bundled with a growing number of plugins. See our [plugin documentation page](https://cudmore.github.io/SanPy/plugins/).
