0. Conclusion

We need to hyperpolarize each cell with dc current injection (to about about -80 mV) so there are no APs. Then, all APs will be due to our stimulation


1. recent article using dc current injection and dynamic clamp

Take Home: show that DC versus dynamic clamp I_KIR alter the shape of evoked APs. Constant hold current reduces AP duration (among other things)

2. holds cell at about -80 (no AP) and evokes spikes with

"APs were elicited in current-clamp mode with a holding current of −40 pA by injection of brief current pulses (2 milliseconds, 1 nA) at a 0.2-Hz stimulation rate."

3. Another paper using current clamp to evoke APs

"APs were triggered by 2 ms long depolarizing pulses at a frequency of 0.5 Hz."

Figure 4: "A holding current was applied to maintain the resting membrane potential (RMP) around −80 mV."

4. Another current clamp experiment to evoke APs

"Trains of APs were stimulated at 50–600 beats min−1 by current-clamping in bridge mode with 3–5 ms pulses, 1.2–1.5× threshold"

"Most human atrial cells required a small (0.87 ± 0.19 pA pF−1, n= 18) constant hyperpolarising current to gain ∼−80 mV resting Vm, as previously (Le Grand et al. 1994; Bénardeau et al. 1996; Workman et al. 2001)."

5. Another current clamp experiment to evoke APs

see fig 3

"Right auricle cardiomyocytes were injected with a small negative current of about -20 pA in order to hyperpolarize the cells to -80 mV"

"Action potentials were elicited by injection of a 2 - 5 ms current pulse of 2 nA amplitude. Action potentials were evoked with a frequency of 1 Hz"
