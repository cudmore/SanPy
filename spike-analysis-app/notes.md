### What is a good recording

- Access resistance (Ra) should be less than 10 MOhm and not changing during the recording

### Action potential analysis

- MDP and Vmax were defined as the most negative and positive membrane potentials, respectively
- Take-off potential (TOP) was defined as the membrane potential when the first derivative of voltage with respect to time (dV/dt) reached 10% of its maximum value
- Cycle length was defined as the interval between MDPs in successive APs
- The maximum rates of the AP upstroke and repolarization were taken as the maximum and minimum values of the first derivative (dV/dtmax and dV/dtmin, respectively)
- Action potential duration (APD) was defined as the interval between the TOP and the subsequent MDP
- APD_50 and APD_90 were defined as the interval between the TOP and 50% and 90% repolarization, respectively
- The diastolic duration was defined as the interval between MDP and TOP
- The early diastolic depolarization rate was estimated as the slope of a linear fit between 10% and 50% of the diastolic duration and the early diastolic duration was the corresponding time interval
- The nonlinear late diastolic depolarization phase was estimated as the duration between 1% and 10% dV/dt
