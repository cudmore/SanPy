Adding the loading of Sparkmaster analysis

The Fiji Plugin "SparkMaster.java" needs to keep its name? Will not load if renamed to "SparkMaster_20210217_.java"???

When running SparkMaster in Fiji, we need to be 100% sure we get the corect parameters

For example:

	For file 20210115__0001.tif
	Lines per second is 235.3257580851206845
